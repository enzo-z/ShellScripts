# ShellScripts
Playing with shell

The purposes of this repository is to track my evolution of knowledge, while preparing some material so that I can teach others about shell scripting.

## What is Shell Scripting?
Basically, a 'Shell Script' is a file which will be interpreted by a Shell Program. There are a lot of shell programs (sh, bash, zsh, tcsh...)
A shell script then is basically text written in a particular way that can be interpreted by a shell program aka. a shell. 

## What is Shell? 
When we talk about shell (sh), usually we are talking about the Bourne Shell. Bourne shell is a interactive command interpreter which is still the standard for most of the implementations of Unix-like systems. It was developed by Stephen Bourne, and launched in 1977 with the Version 7 of Unix. 

The interpreter of sh is located at /bin/sh, along with many others, like bash (Bourne Again Shell), which will be the main interpreter used in this repository.
